## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learnt how to make basic API Calls using the fetch API.

Also centering an absolutely positioned element turned out to be a thing ðŸ™ƒ. Luckily I found this solution on StackOverflow

```css
.absoluteElement {
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-52%, 0);
}
```

The JS was actually straight forward.

### Useful resources

- [AltAcademy Fetch API](https://www.altcademy.com/blog/how-to-use-the-javascript-fetch-api-to-get-data/) - This helped me learn how to make API calls and fetch data from an api.
- [Neon Button](https://youtu.be/ex7jGbyFgpA?si=2Bv9dvQDDDUDRLKa) - This is video helped me create a basic neon effect using multiple box-shadows.
